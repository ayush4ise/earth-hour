# Earth Hour Energy Demand Analysis üåçüí°

## Description
This repository contains an analysis of Singapore's yearly energy demand data during Earth Hour and regular Saturdays. The analysis aimed to assess the impact of Earth Hour on energy consumption over the past five years (2018-2022).

## Folder Structure
The repository includes a folder named "Yearly Energy Demand Data," storing yearly Excel files with half-hourly energy demand data specific to Singapore.

## Project Details
The analysis was supervised by Professor S. Vishwanathan, focusing on evaluating the significant difference in energy demand between Earth Hour and other Saturdays. Monthly seasonalities used to deseasonalize the data were calculated by averaging the monthly seasonalities for the years 2011-2017 from a separate project.
